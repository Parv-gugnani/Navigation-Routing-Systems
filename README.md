## Introduction

Navigation and routing systems are crucial components in today's digital world. This React project aims to showcase how these systems can be integrated into web applications for a variety of purposes, from simple navigation to complex logistics solutions.

## Features

- **Interactive Map:** Visualize routes and locations on an interactive map.
- **Route Planning:** Plan and display routes between different points of interest.
- **Real-Time Traffic:** Incorporate real-time traffic data into the app for dynamic route updates.
- **Custom Markers:** Add custom markers and annotations to the map.
- **User-friendly Interface:** A responsive and intuitive user interface for easy interaction.

## Brief :smile:

> Components: These are like building blocks for your app. Each page or section of your app is made up of components. For example, you might have a "Header" component for the top of your app and a "Footer" component for the bottom.

> State: This is like the memory of your app. It remembers things like what page you're on or what data you're working with. You can use the useState hook to manage state in functional components.

> Router: The router is like a traffic cop for your app. It figures out which page/component to show based on the URL. In React, you can use a library called react-router to set up your routes.

> Routes: These are like the roads on the map. Each route is associated with a specific component. For example, you might have a route for the homepage and another for a contact page.

> Links: Links are like signposts on the road. They are used to navigate between different pages or routes. In React, you can use the Link component from react-router-dom to create links.

> Hooks: Hooks are special functions in React that let you do things like managing state (useState), handling side effects (useEffect), and more. They make it easier to build interactive apps.

`import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function HomePage() {
return <div>Welcome to the homepage!</div>;
}

function AboutPage() {
return <div>This is the about page.</div>;
}

function App() {
return (
<Router>

<nav>
<ul>
<li>
<Link to="/">Home</Link>
</li>
<li>
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
</li>
</ul>
</nav>

      <Route path="/" exact component={HomePage} />
      <Route path="/about" component={AboutPage} />
    </Router>

);
}

export default App; `
